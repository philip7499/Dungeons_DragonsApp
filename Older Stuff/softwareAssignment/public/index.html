           <p>A role-playing game (sometimes spelled roleplaying game; abbreviated RPG) is a game in which players assume the roles of characters in a fictional setting. Players take responsibility for acting out these roles within a narrative, either through literal acting, or through a process of structured decision-making regarding character development. Actions taken within many games succeed or fail according to a formal system of rules and guidelines.</p>

            <h4 id="menu2">Dungeons & Dragons</h4>
            <p>Dungeons & Dragons (commonly abbreviated as D&D or DnD) is a fantasy tabletop role-playing game (RPG) originally designed by Gary Gygax and Dave Arneson. It was first published in 1974 by Tactical Studies Rules, Inc. (TSR). It has been published by Wizards of the Coast (now a subsidiary of Hasbro) since 1997. The game was derived from miniature wargames, with a variation of the 1971 game Chainmail serving as the initial rule system. D&D's publication is commonly recognized as the beginning of modern role-playing games and the role-playing game industry.</p>

            <h4 id="menu3">Play Overview</h4>
            <p>Dungeons & Dragons is a structured, yet fundamentally open-ended role-playing game. It is normally played indoors with the participants seated around a tabletop. Typically, one player takes on the role of Dungeon Master (DM) while the others each control a single character, representing an individual in a fictional setting. When working together as a group, the player characters (PCs) are often described as a "party" of adventurers, with each member often having their own area of specialty which contributes to the success of the whole. During the course of play, each player directs the actions of their character and their interactions with other characters in the game. This activity is performed through the verbal impersonation of the characters by the players, while employing a variety of social and other useful cognitive skills, such as logic, basic mathematics and imagination. A game often continues over a series of meetings to complete a single adventure, and longer into a series of related gaming adventures, called a "campaign".</p>

            <h4 id="menu4" >Licensing history
</h4>
            <p>The first Dungeons & Dragons licensed games were made by Mattel for the Intellivision. The contract actually required some variations to the normal Intellivision title screens with the name being capitalized and the addition of the word 'cartridge'. The games, however, had nothing to do with the rules or any of the settings. The first license for video games based upon the Dungeons & Dragons rules was awarded to Strategic Simulations, Inc. (SSI) in 1987 after ten companies had applied. SSI won the award primarily because of their broader vision and their experience in computerized wargaming.[2] After a successful run with their Gold Box series of games, SSI lost their exclusive license in 1994. TSR then divided the license among multiple publishers.</p>

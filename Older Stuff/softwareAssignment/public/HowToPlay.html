    <h1>The Rules</h1>
</div>
<div class="Intro">
<p>D&D Fifth Edition is a very complex game that is very simple to play. There are two distinct groups when playing, one person is the DM (Dungeon Master) and the rest are the players. If you were to compare D&D to a computer game the DM would be the computer while the players would be, well, the player. The DM creates a world and a story, describes it to the players and allows them to interact with the world as they choose, using the rules as a framework to do so. The players create characters to interact with this world, these characters have abilities based on their class, race and background. This application will help you keep track of those things.</p>

<div class="DiceRules">
    <p>The game, while having many rules for more detailed scenarios, follows a very simple format. The DM will describe the scene and the players will say what they want to do. The DM will then decide what skill that uses and how difficult it is. The player will roll a 20 sided dice to decide if they succeed or fail at their action and the DM will resolve the results of that action, possibly involving the rolling of other types of dice depending on the type of action. Every aspect of the game follows this basic formula, however there are an infinite number of ways it could possibly be applied.</p>

<div class="Abilities">
    <p> There are six ability scores in D&D: Strength, Constitution, Dexterity, Wisdom, Intelligence and Charisma. Unless other wise specified these abilities have a maximum of 20. The level you have in this skill indicates your bonus, which is 0 for a score of 10 and add or subtracts one at every even number from there.</p>
</div>

<div class="skills">
    <p>Each ability comes with a set of skills which fall under it. These skills help the DM decide the type of roll the players are required to make to decide the result of their action. </p>

<p>The skills are as follows:<br><br>
Strength: Athletics<br>
Dexterity: Acrobatics, Sleight of Hand, Stealth<br>
Intelligence: Arcana, History, Investigation, Nature, Religion<br>
Wisdom: Animal Handling, Insight, Medicine, Perception, Survival<br>
    Charisma: Deception, Intimidation, Performance, Persuasion</p>
